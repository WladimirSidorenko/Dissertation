\maketitle

In my dissertation, I address the problem of automatic analysis of
sentiments (\ie{} subjective evaluative opinions) in German tweets.
In particular, I investigate the ways and means by how people express
their opinions in online microblogs, examine current approaches to
automatic mining of these feelings, and propose my own methods that
outperform many existing techniques.  I perform these tasks on three
different linguistic levels: subsentential (level of words and
phrases), sentential (level of single statements), and suprasentential
(level of discourse), making thereby the following claims:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item I argue that \textbf{the analysis of subjective evaluative
    opinions is an inherently difficult task even for human experts}.

    This argument is empirically confirmed by an extensive
    inter-annotator agreement (IAA) study that I performed while
    creating the Potsdam Twitter Sentiment Corpus~(PotTS), which I
    present in Chapter~2.

  \item\textbf{The difficulty of this task crucially depends on the
    topic and form of analyzed tweets}, \eg{} political messages
    containing emoticons are more challenging to judge upon than
    casual everyday microblogs without smileys.

    This finding is again bolstered by the IAA results that I obtained
    for tweets coming from different topics and formal categories.

  \item\textbf{Most annotation ambiguities can be resolved by making
    the experts aware of alternative interpretations by other
    linguists}.

    Since the IAA scores at the initial stage of working on the PotTS
    corpus were relatively low (31.21\% $\kappa$), I applied a simple
    adjudication step in which I highlighted the differences between
    the annotations of two linguists and let them resolve these
    disagreements independently of each other.  This procedure not
    only boosted the $\kappa$-score almost twice but also allowed the
    annotators to maintain a high level of mutual agreement when
    annotating the rest of the data.
\end{enumerate}
Turning to the evaluation of particular sentiment analysis (SA)
resources and methods, I claim that
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{Existing automatically translated and manually revised
  German sentiment lexicons have a better quality than the results of
  automatic lexicon generation (LG) methods that are applied to German
  data};

\item\textbf{Among automatic LG methods, dictionary-based approaches
  yield overall better scores than corpus and word-embedding--based
  systems.  The last group, however, represents a good alternative to
  dictionary-based solutions in case when a manually annotated lexical
  ontology is absent};

\item In Chapter~4, I turn my attention to \emph{aspect-based
  sentiment analysis}, whose goal is to predict text spans of
  sentiments, their holders, and targets.  Based on my experiments, I
  come to the conclusion that \textbf{aspect-based sentiment analysis
    is better addressed with probabilistic graphical models, such as
    conditional random fields (CRFs), rather than recurrent neural
    networks}.  Moreover, \textbf{the results of the standard
    first-order linear-chain CRFs can be further improved by
    increasing the order and redefining the structure of the CRF
    graph};

\item Afterwards in Chapter~5, I compare different approaches to
  \emph{message-level sentiment analysis} (MLSA), where the task is to
  classify the overall polarity of a tweet as positive, negative, or
  neutral.  For this purpose, I compare three major groups of methods:
  lexicon-, machine-learning--, and deep-learning--based ones, making
  the conclusion that \textbf{message-level sentiment analysis is more
    amenable to machine- and deep-learning--based paradigms} and that
  \textbf{DL-based methods can further benefit from the incorporation
    of sentiment-lexicon information};

\item Finally, in the last chapter, I prove that \textbf{one can
  further improve message-level SA results by taking into account the
  discourse structure of the tweet}, \ie{} not analyzing the microblog
  as a whole at once, but instead predicting the sentiment scores
  separately for each of its sentences and inferring the polarity of
  the tweet from these scores;
\end{enumerate}

Based on the experiments in the above chapters, I conclude that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To a large extent, \textbf{we can apply opinion mining methods
    devised for standard English to German Twitter}, provided that the
    original training objective, the evaluation metrics, as well as
    the size and reliability of the training data used for these
    methods are close to the respective parameters in the German SA
    task at hand;
  \item \textbf{The peculiarities and dificulties of the social-media
    genre can be efficiently addressed with text normalization},
    which, as I have shown in Chapters~4 and~5, not only improves the
    scores of aspect-based sentiment analysis but signigicantly boosts
    the accuracy of message-level classification as well.
\end{enumerate}
