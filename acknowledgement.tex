At the beginning of this thesis, I would like to say a really big thank you to
all people who supported me throughout these difficult but immensely enjoyable
years of work on my dissertation; to people who always were there, when I
needed them; to people who taught, advised, and helped me with my research and
who, I believe, made me stronger, perhaps more clever, and probably also more
confident in my knowledge.  These people are my colleagues, my friends, my
teachers, but, first of all, my family and my advisor.

I am heavily indebted to all my supporters and I am absolutely convinced that
this work would have never come into existence without them.  I am also fairly
sure that it would take me another dissertation to express the whole debt of
gratitude that I owe each of my helpers, but I am afraid they would not like
to wait for me that long to finish it.  Therefore, as hard as it is, I have to
keep myself short in this acknowledgment and try to describe all the infinite
gratefulness that I feel for my supporters with just few but utterly sincere
words.

First and foremost, I, of course, would like to thank my family who
faithfully supported me throughout these difficult and exhausting
years.  Unfortunately, these people also were those who suffered most
from my absence at home and the lack of my spare time.  So, taking the
opportunity to speak to them from these pages, I would like to
simultaneously apologize for my possibly neglected family duties and
to promise that I will make up for them twofold after my defense.

Of course, I had not spent so much time in the university office if I
did not have such great colleagues as Tatjana Scheffler, Arne Neumann,
Yulia Grishina, and Andreas Peldszus.  I thank Tatjana for her help
with our research project ``Discourse Analysis of Social Media'' and
for her valuable advices and corrections of my papers.  I thank Arne
for our talks, cultural excursions, and his nice attitude to the
people.  And I am, of course, much indebted to Yulia who was the most
reliable annotator in our numerous runs of annotation experiments.

I am also grateful to Thomas Hanneforth for his time and his priceless
research hints that he gave me in the initial phase of my research.

%% Speaking of colleagues and friends, I, of course, would like to thank
%% Nikos Engonopoulos and Mart\'{i}n Villalba for many enjoyable hours

%% gratitude to our technical assistants -- Annett E\ss{}linger , Ralf

%% everyday issues.

%% Annett has always been indispensable in handling all my questions
%% concering official documents.  And thanks to Ralf and Siegfried, we

%% work more efficiently.

There are certainly many other people whom I would like to mention and
who made a significant contribution to the progress of this thesis,
but, as I said, I have to keep myself short.  So, if I failed to
mention somebody on these pages, I can assure that I did that not due
to the lack of my gratitude but because of limited writing space and
lacking time.  To mitigate this, I address my final big thank you to
all those who remained unnamed in this section but who feel that they
have made this work possible.
