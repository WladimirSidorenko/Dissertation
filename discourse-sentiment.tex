\citet{Voll:07} addressed the problem of classifying the polarity of
Epinions reviews.\footnote{\url{www.epinions.com}} For this purpose,
they applied the SO-CAL system (Semantic Orientation CALculator) to
adjectives appearing in the user posts, considering three ways of
pre-filtering this input: In the first (baseline) approach, they
invariably passed all adjectives found in the review to SO-CAL.  In
the second method, they only analyzed those words which appeared in
the top-most nuclei of the sentences.  These nuclei were determined
automatically by an RST parsing system \cite[SPADE; ][]{Soricut:03}.
Finally, in the third experiment, the authors trained a decision-tree
classifier, which predicted whether a particular sentence pertained to
the general topic of its document or not, and applied the sentiment
system only to those sentences which were classified as
topic-relevant.  With this last approach, \citeauthor{Voll:07} were
able to obtain their best results (69\% accuracy), getting their
second-best scores with the system which considered all adjectives.
The suboptimal results of the discourse-based approach were partially
explained by the limited performance of the automatic RST system.

\citet{Trivedi:13} presented a latent-variable approach, in which they
tried to predict the overall polarity of a document using a set of
unigram attributes augmented by special discourse connectives
and polarity coherence features.

Other ways of incorporating discourse structure into opinion mining
applications were proposed by~\citet{Bhatia:15}.  In their work, the
authors proposed two methods for augmenting a sentiment analysis
system with discourse information:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item discourse depth reweighting and
\item rhetorical recursive neural network (R2N2).
\end{inparaenum}
In the former approach, they introduced a special parameter $\lambda_i$:
\begin{equation*}
  \lambda_i = \max\left(0.5, 1 - d_i/6\right),
\end{equation*}
where $d_i$ stands for the depth of an elementary discourse unit in
the discourse tree of the whole document.  With this parameter, they
estimated the overall polarity of a document~$\Psi$, by summing up the
individual linaer predictions for each sentence scaled by~$\lambda_i$:
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = \sum_i\lambda_i\mathbf{\theta}^T\cdot\mathbf{w}_i,
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{\theta}$ represents a vector of polarity scores ($-1$
for negative terms and $+1$ for positive) obtained from the sentiment
lexicon of~\citet{Wilson:05}, and $w_i$ stands for the bag-of-words
representation of the $i$-th sentence.  In the R2N2 method, the
authors adopted the RNN approach of~\citet{Socher:13} and recursively
estimated the polarity of a document from the leaves of the RST tree
up to its root.
