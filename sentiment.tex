\chapter{Sentiment Analysis}

\section{Introduction to Sentiment Analysis}

Interpersonal communication is not only a way to share objective
information with other people but also a vibrant channel to convey
one's subjective thoughts, attitudes, and feelings.  It is, in fact,
this latter use which provides a personal touch to our discourses,
making them more grasping, more entertaining, and more living.  And it
is often this use which significantly influences our decisions,
preferences, and choices in everyday life.  Therefore, a high-quality
automatic analysis of the subjective part of information is typically
not less important than the extraction and analysis of objective
facts.

The field of knowledge which deals with the analysis of people's
opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions
towards particular entities mentioned in discourse is called
\emph{sentiment analysis} (SA) \citep{Liu:12}.  The definition of this
discipline, however, much like the definition of the term
\emph{sentiment} itself is neither complete nor universally accepted.
The main reasons for these controversies are
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape i)\upshape]
  \item a frequently unclear delimitation of the subjective and
    objective components of information and
  \item the heteroginity of the language system, to which SA methods
    are applied.
\end{inparaenum}

The former factor, for instance, makes it difficult to delimitate what
kinds of events and expressions should actually belong to the domain
of sentiment analysis and which ones shall rather be excluded from it.
A prominent example of such problematic borderline cases are the
so-called subjective facts, such as \emph{terrorist attacks} or
\emph{cancer drugs}, which some people perceive as emotionally laden
terms while others regard them as purely objective statements.

The latter factor complicates a precise definition of SA because
different levels of language have their own concepts of subjectivity,
which in turn require different approaches and methods of analysis.
Depending on the language level being analyzed, researchers typically
distinguish three different subtypes of sentiment analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item\emph{subsentential} of \emph{fine-grained} SA whose task is to
    determine and analyze specific subjective opinions and/or
    evealuations within single clauses,
  \item\emph{sentential} analysis which tries to ascribe a single
    polarity class to each sentence in a text, and
  \item\emph{suprasentential} or \emph{document-level} sentiment
    classification which seeks to determine the polarity and
    subjectivity classes of complete discourses.
\end{itemize}

Each of these subtypes has its own characteristic strengths and
weaknesses.  The fine-grained SA, for example, is typically considered
to be the ultimate goal of any opinion mining\footnote{Following
  \citet{Liu:12}, we do not make a distinction between the terms
  \emph{opinion mining} and \emph{sentiment analysis} in this thesis
  and use both names interchangeably in our work.}  system as it aims
at the highest possible recall of all subjective expressions occurring
in text.  At the same time, this task is unfortunately very
challenging even for human beings, as we will show in Section
\ref{sec:corpus}, let alone computer programs.  The consequently low
results often prevent subsentential SA systems from being used in
industrial applications.

The last two subdisciplines (sentential and document-level sentiment
analyses) can be considered as approximations of the first one.  They
coarsen the targeted recall down to the level of sentences or texts
respectively, assuming that there can be only one (most prominent)
expression of subjectivity per analyzed unit.  In contrast to
fine-grained SA, these approaches typically yield better results but,
again, this improvement comes at the cost of loosing some important
details.

As it can be seen, speaking of the difficulty or easiness of sentiment
analysis for a specific domain in general is in the same way wrong as
judging about the amenability of this domain to natural language
processing: one always has to specify the level of granularity that
the SA system under scrutiny is dealing with as she has to specify the
particular NLP task whose difficulty is estimated.

In this chapter, we will primarily concentrate on the most challenging
SA objective -- that of the fine-grained SA.  After a brief summary of
related work done on the opinion mining for social media so far, we
will introduce a comprehensive corpus of German tweets that has been
created as part of this work.  A detailed inter-annotator agreement
study of this dataset will reveal which linguistic and
extra-linguistic factors significantly influence the distribution of
sentiments in Twitter and which of them cause utter confusion among
human experts.  After obtaining an upper bound on human performance
for SA, we will successively compare with it the results attained by
automatic sentiment systems, starting with the most fundamental task
of recognizing subjective expression and concluding with the ultimate
aim of recognizing textual spans of sentiments, their objects of
evaluation (\emph{targets}), and authors (\emph{sources}).
