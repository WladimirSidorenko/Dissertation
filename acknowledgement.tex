Acknowledgment.

At the beginning of this thesis, I would like to say a really big
thank you to all the people who supported me throughout these
difficult but at the same time immensely enjoyable years of work on my
dissertation.  It were these people who always were there, when I
needed them.  It were these people who taught, advised, and helped me
with my research.  And it were they who, I believe, made me stronger,
more clever, and perhaps also more confident in my knowledge.  I am
heavily indebted to all of them and I am absolutely convinced that
this work had never come into existence if I did not have such a great
working environment as I was lucky to have it in Potsdam.

It would certainly take me another dissertation to express all the
great debt of gratitude that I owe to my colleagues, teachers,
friends, advisors, and family, but I am afraid they would not like to
wait for me that long to finish it.  So, I should rather constrain
myself in this acknowledgment and try to compress all the infinite
gratefulness that I have for all of them in just few but still
essential words.

First of all, I certainly would like to thank my advisor, Manfred
Stede, who was much more a real ``Doktorvater'' than just a scientific
supervisor for me.  I thank Manfred for his courage in employing me,
for the numerous hours that he invested in our discussions, for his
valuable hints, criticism, and suggestions.  Manfred's experience,
patience, and wisdom
