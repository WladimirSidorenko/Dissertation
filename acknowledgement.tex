\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgment}

At the beginning of this thesis, I would like to say a really big thank you to
all people who supported me throughout these difficult but immensely enjoyable
years of work on my dissertation; to people who always were there, when I
needed them; to people who taught, advised, and helped me with my research and
who, I believe, made me stronger, perhaps more clever, and probably also more
confident in my knowledge.  These people are my colleagues, my friends, my
teachers, but, first of all, my family and my advisor.

I am heavily indebted to all my supporters and I am absolutely convinced that
this work would have never come into existence without them.  I am also fairly
sure that it would take me another dissertation to express the whole debt of
gratitude that I owe each of my helpers, but I am afraid they would not like
to wait for me that long to finish it.  Therefore, as hard as it is, I have to
keep myself short in this acknowledgment and try to describe all the infinite
gratefulness that I feel for my supporters with just few but utterly sincere
words.

First and foremost, I, of course, would like to thank my advisor, Manfred
Stede, who was much more a ``Doktorvater'' than just a supervisor for me.  I
thank Manfred for his courage in employing me, for the numerous hours that he
invested in our discussions, and for his valuable hints, suggestions, and
criticism.  His experience and wisdom laid the foundation for the success of
this work.  And his patience allowed me to bring this thesis to the end.  I am
very thankful to Manfred that he introduced me to the amazing world of
science, a world which does not require a visa but which does require a sober
mind and a considerable load of knowledge.  I sincerely hope that he will open
the doors to this unbelievably beautiful world for many other Ph.D. students
that he will certainly have in the future.

For sure, having a good ``Doktorvater'' is an obligatory precondition for any
completed dissertation, but another prerequisite which plays an equally
important role is still one's own family at home.  And I have to admit that I
was extremely lucky with both my families: the scientific and the traditional
one.  My wife and my parents have always given me an incredible support.  And,
unfortunately, they also were those who, I think, suffered most from my
absence at home and the lack of my spare time.  So, taking the opportunity to
speak to them from these pages, I would like to simultaneously apologize for
my possibly neglected family duties and to promise that I will make up for
them twofold after my defense.

Of course, I had not spent so much time in the university office if I did not
have such great colleagues as Tatjana Scheffler, Stephan Oepen, Arne Neumann,
Yulia Grishina, Andreas Peldszus, and Jonathan Sonntag.  I thank Tatjana for
her help with our research project ``Discourse Analysis of Social Media'' and
for her valuable advices and corrections of my papers.  I thank Arne for our
talks, cultural excursions, and his nice attitude to the people.  And I am, of
course, much indebted to Yulia who was the most reliable annotator in our
numerous runs of annotation experiments.

I am also grateful to our colleagues from the chair of Theoretical
Computational Linguistics -- Alexander Koller and Thomas Hanneforth.  The
consummate quality of Alexander's work set an example for me that I eagerly
tried to follow.  And even if my attempt is still far away from being
completed, it would have been even less successful if I did not take the
unique opportunity to attend Thomas Henneforth's courses in automata theory
and C++ programming.  And I am especially thankful to Thomas for his time and
his priceless research hints that he gave me in our consultations.

I also want to express my gratitude to Konstantina Garoufi, Nikos
Engonopoulos, Mart\'{i}n Villalba, and \v{Z}eljko Agi\'{c}.  It has always
been a pleasure for me to listen to them in our talks and to enjoy their
company during our lunches.  I wish them great success in their academic and
scientific careers and I am also already looking forward to seeing them at
conferences, workshops, and in everyday life.

Last but not least, I would like to thank our technical assistants: Annett
E\ss{}linger , Ralf Ditsch, and Siegfried Wrobel for their help in solving
everyday issues and problems.  Annett has always been indispensable in
handling all my questions concering official documents.  And thanks to Ralf
and Siegfried, we had an excellent network infrastructure which helped me
organize my work more efficiently.

There are, of course, many other people whom I would like to mention and who
made a significant contribution to the progress of this thesis, but, as I
said, I have to keep myself short.  So, if I failed to mention somebody on
these pages, I can assure that I did that not due to the lack of my gratitude
but due to the lack of writing space and time.  And I would like to address my
final big thank you in this acknowledgment to all those who remained unnamed
in this section but who feel that they have made this work possible.
