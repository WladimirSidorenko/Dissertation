\chapter*{Introduction}
\epigraph{\itshape Romance should never begin with sentiment. It should begin
  with science and end with a settlement.}{Oscar Wilde: \textit{An Ideal
    Husband}}

When Oscar Wilde's famous masterpiece ``An Ideal Husband'' was first performed
on the stage in 1895, its audience hardly knew anything about the Internet,
Twitter or any other kind of social networks. What people at that time,
however, knew about was politics and what they felt were real emotions.

Today, the world has changed.  It is now much more likely to meet a person who
knows almost everything about followers, likes and re-tweets on Twitter or
Facebook than one who knows who Oscar Wilde is or who cares about political
issues in the local government.

The worlds did not diverge completely though.  There are still people
interested in political maters and many of them are also fimiliar with the
Internet-based communication means.  But even more important is that we still
feel emotions, only that the ways of expressing our feelings have probably
changed -- from face to face to screen to screen mode.

This dissertation investigates the cut surface of emotions, politics, and
web-based talks.
