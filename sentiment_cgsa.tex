\chapter{Coarse-Grained Sentiment Analysis}\label{sec:snt:cgsa}

Having familiarized ourselves with the peculiarities of a sentiment
corpus, the different possibilities to automatically induce new
polarity lists, and the difficulties of fine-grained opinion mining,
we now move on to the presumably most popular sentiment analysis
objective---the coarse-grained analysis or CGSA, in which we need to
determine the overall polarity of a message.

Traditionally, this task has been addessed with either of three
popular groups of methods:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item lexicon-based approaches,
  \item machine-learning-based (ML) techniques, and
  \item deep-learning-based (DL) applications.
\end{inparaenum}
In this chapter, we are going to scrutinize the most prominent
representatives of each of these paradigms and also tackle a much more
ambitious goal, namely to check whether we can achieve results
comparable with the scores of these methods when the language of the
domain we train on is completely different from the language of the
test data.

We begin our comparison by first presenting the metrics that we will
use in our subsequent evaluation.  After a brief description of the
data preparation step, we proceed to the actual estimation of popular
lexicon-, ML-, and DL-based approaches, explaining and evaluating them
in Sections~\ref{sec:cgsa:lexicon-based}, \ref{sec:cgsa:ml-based},
and~\ref{sec:cgsa:dl-based} respectively.  Then,
in~Section~\ref{sec:cgsa:domain-adaptation}, we also show which
results can be obtained by using cross-lingual transfer, where we
train a classifier on English microblogs and then adapt this system to
German messages.  Finally, we conclude with an extensive evaluation of
different hyperparameters and settings (including various types of
sentiment lexicons, different kinds of word embeddings, the utility of
the text normalization step, and the impact of additional noisily
labeled training data), summarizing our results and recapping our
findings at the end of this chapter.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}\label{sec:cgsa:eval-metrics}

To estimate the quality of the compared systems, we will use two
established evaluation metrics which are commonly applied for
measuring CGSA results: One of these metrics is the macro-averaged
\F-score over the two major polarity classes~(positive and negative):
{ \small%
  \begin{equation*}
    F_1 = \frac{F_{pos} + F_{neg}}{2}.
  \end{equation*}%
  \normalsize%
}%
This measure was first introduced by the organizers of the SemEval
competition~\cite{Nakov:13,Rosenthal:14,Rosenthal:15} and has become a
de facto standard not only for the SemEval dataset, but virtually for
all related sentiment tasks and corpora.

The second metric is the micro-averaged \F-score over all three
possible semantic orientations (positive, negative, and neutral),
which basically corresponds to the accuracy over the whole labeled
dataset~\cite[cf.][p.~577]{Manning:99}.  This measure both predates
and supersedes the SemEval evaluation as it had already been applied
in the very first works on coarse-grained opinion
mining~\cite{Wiebe:99,Das:01,Read:05,Kennedy:06,Go:09} and was again
reintroduced in the GermEval Shared Task on Sentiment
Analysis~2017~\cite{Biemann:17}.

Moreover, in addition to these two metrics, we will also give a
detailed information on precision, recall, and \F-scores of each
particular polarity class in order to get a better intuition about
precise strengths, weaknesses, and biases of each evaluated CGSA
method.

\section{Data Preparation}\label{sec:cgsa:data}

Similarly to the data preparation steps used for fine-grained
sentiment analysis, we preprocessed all tweets of the PotTS
corpus~\cite{Sidarenka:16} with the text normalization system
of~\citet{Sidarenka:13}, tokenized them using the same adjusted
version of Potts'
tokenizer,\footnote{\url{http://sentiment.christopherpotts.net/code-data/happyfuntokenizing.py}}
lemmatized and assigned part-of-speech tags to these tokens with the
\texttt{TreeTagger} of~\citet{Schmid:95}.  Furthermore, like in the
previous chapter, we automatically obtained morphological features for
each word and induced syntactic trees for each sentence with the help
of the \texttt{Mate} dependency parser~of~\citet{Bohnet:13}. Apart
from the PotTS dataset, we also applied this procedure to the
microblogs of the German Twitter snapshot~\cite{Scheffler:14}, which
will be used in our subsequent experiments on noisy supervision.

We again divided the corpus data into a training, development, and
test set, using 70\% of the tweets for learning, 10\% for tuning and
picking the optimal hyperparameters, and the remaining 20\% for
evaluating the results.  We inferred polarity labels for these
microblogs with a simple heuristic rule, assigning the positive
(negative) class to all messages which contained exclusively positive
(negative) sentiments, considering all tweets without any polar
opinions as neutral, and skipping all microblogs that contained
sentiments with opposite semantic orientations.  Finally, to derive
these classes for the snapshot posts, we followed the procedure
proposed by~\citet{Read:05} and~\citet{Go:09}, and assigned the
positive (negative) labels to the tweets which contained the
respective emoticons.

\section{Lexicon-Based Methods}\label{sec:cgsa:lexicon-based}

The first group of approaches that we are going to explore in this
chapter using the described data are lexicon-based (LB) systems.  Just
like sentiment lexicons themselves, LB methods for coarse-grained
opinion mining have attracted a lot of attention from the very
inception of the sentiment analysis field.  Starting with the research
of~\citet{Hatzivassi:00}, who proved with statistical significance
tests that the mere occurrence of a subjective adjective from a
polarity list was a highly reliable indicator of the whole sentence
being subjective, more and more works dealing with the use of lexicons
for determining the overall polarity of complete texts appeared on the
scene.  For example, \citet{Das:01} already applied an ensemble of
five classifiers (two of which were purely lexicon-based and the other
three relied on lexicon features) to predict the polarity of stock
messages (\emph{buy}, \emph{sell}, or \emph{neutral}), attaining an
accuracy of 62\% on a corpus of several hundreds stock board messages.
In contrast to this complex approach, \citet{Turney:02} simply
determined the \emph{semantic orientation} (SO) of the reviews by
averaging the sentiment scores of their terms found in the
automatically generated PMI lexicon.  With this approach, the author
could reach an accuracy of 74\% on a corpus of 410 manually labeled
Epinions comments.  Following this line of research, \citet{Kim:04}
compared three different approaches to determining the polarity of a
sentence:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item by multiplying the signs of its polar terms,
\item by taking the sum of their scores, and
\item by computing the geometric mean of these values;
\end{inparaenum}
finding the first and the last option working best on the Document
Undestanding Corpus.\footnote{\url{http://duc.nist.gov/}}

% % Hu and Liu, 2004
% Similarly, \citet{Hu:04} determined the semantic orientation of
% sentences in customer reviews by simply comparing the number of
% positive and negative terms found in these passages. Since the
% authors, however, were primarily interested in estimating the polarity
% towards particular product features mentioned in the clauses, they
% additionally applied a fallback strategy in case of a tie by checking
% which of the polar lexicon terms appeared closer to the features, and
% assuming the polarity of the preceding sentence if these numbers were
% also equal.

% % Taboada et al., 2004
% Largely inspired by the Appraisal theory of~\citet{Martin:00},
% \citet{Taboada:04} enhanced the original method of~\citet{Turney:02}
% by increasing the weights of polar adjectives which occurred in the
% middle and at the end of a document, and also augmenting these values
% with the affect, judgement, and appreciation scores.  Similarly to
% polarity, the appraisal scores were calculated automatically by
% computing the PMI of their cooccurrence with different pronouns using
% a web search engine.

% Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006
In~\citeyear{Polanyi:06}, \citeauthor{Polanyi:06} presented an
extensive overview and analysis of common lexicon-based approaches,
arguing that, besides considering the lexical valence (i.e., semantic
orientation) of polar terms, it was also necessary to incorporate
syntactic, discourse-level, and extra-linguistic factors such as
negations, intensifiers, modal operators (e.g., \emph{could} or
\emph{might}), presuppositional items (e.g., \emph{barely} or
\emph{failure}), irony, reported speech, discourse connectors, genre
and attitude assessment, reported speech, multi-entity evaluation,
etc.  This theoretical hypothesis was also proven empirically by
\citet{Kennedy:06}, who compared two ways of determining the polarity
of a customer review: In the first of these methods, they simply
compared the numbers of positive and negative expressions appearing in
text, assigning the review to the class with the greater number of
terms.  In the second attempt, they enhanced the original system with
additional information about contextual valence shifters, increasing
or decreasing the sentiment score of a term if it was preceded by an
intensifier or downtoner, and changing the polarity sign of this score
to the opposite in case of a negation.  With this adjustment, the
authors achieved a statistically significant improvement, boosting the
accuracy of the two-class prediction on a corpus of product and movie
reviews from 67.9 to 69.3\%.

% Taboada et al., 2011
Finally, a veritably seminal work on lexicon-based techniques for CGSA
was introduced by~\citet{Taboada:11}, who presented a manually
compiled polarity list\footnote{The authors hand-annotated all
  occurrences of adjectives, nouns, and verbs found in a corpus of 400
  Epinions reviews with ordinal categories ranging from -5 to 5 which
  reflected the semantic orientation of a term (positive vs. negative)
  and its polar strength (weak vs. strong).} and used this resource to
estimate the overall semantic orientation of the text.  Drawing on the
ideas of~\citet{Polanyi:06}, the authors also incorporated a set of
additional heuristic rules into their computation by changing the
prior SO values of negated, itensified, and downtoned terms, ignoring
irrealis sentences, and adjusting the weights of specific document
sections.  An extensive evaluation of this approach showed the
superior performance of the manual lexicon in comparison with other
polarity lists, including the Subjectivity
Dictionary~\cite{Wilson:05}, Maryland Polarity Set~\cite{Mohammad:09},
and \textsc{SentiWordNet}~\cite{Esuli:06c}.  Moreover, the authors
also demonstrated the effectiveness of their method for other topics
and text genres, hypothesizing that lexion-based approaches were in
general more robust to domain shifts than traditional supervised
learning techniques.

% % Taboada et al., 2006
% Another important contribution to the development of lexicon-based
% approaches was made by~\citet{Taboada:06}, who compared three popular
% polarity lists---a PMI lexicon computed with the original method
% of~\citet{Turney:02} using the AltaVista's NEAR operator; a similar
% polarity list obtained with the help of Google's AND queries; and,
% finally, the manually compiled General Inquirer lexicon
% of~\citet{Stone:66}.  The authors evaluated these resources both
% intrinsically (by comparing them with GI entries) and extrinsically
% (by computing the polarity of 400 manually annotated Epinions
% reviews).  To estimate the overall polarity of a review for the second
% task, \citeauthor{Taboada:06} calculated the average SO value of all
% polar terms found in the review, obtaining these scores from the
% mean-normalized lexicons, and flipping the polarity sign to the
% opposite in case of the negation.

% Musto et al., 2014
Lexicon-based systems also found their way into sentiment analysis of
social media: An LB approach specifically tailored to Twitter data
was, for instance, proposed by~\citet{Musto:14}, who examined four
different ways of computing the overall polarity scores of microblogs:
\emph{basic}, \emph{normalized}, \emph{emphasized}, and
\emph{normalized-emphasized}; checking these strategies with four
distinct lexicons: \textsc{Sen\-ti\-Word\-Net}~\cite{Esuli:06c},
\textsc{Word\-Net-\-Affect}~\cite{Strapparava:04},
\textsc{MPQA}~\cite{Wiebe:05}, and
\textsc{SenticNet}~\cite{Cambria:14}.  In all of these methods, the
authors first split an input message into a list of
\emph{micro-phrases} based on the occurrence of punctuation marks and
conjunctions; then calculated the polarity score of each of these
segments; and, finally, estimated the overall polarity of the tweet by
uniting the scores of the micro-phrases.  \citeauthor{Musto:14}
obtained their best results (58.99\% accuracy on the SemEval-2013
dataset) with the normalized-emphasized approach, in which they
averaged the polarity scores of segments' tokens, boosting these
values by 50\% for informative parts of speech; and regarded the sum
of the micro-phrase scores as the final overall polarity of the
microblog.

% the authors obtained their best results using the
% \textsc{SentiWordNet} lexicon of~\citet{Esuli:06c}

% Jurek et al., 2015
Another Twitter-aware system was presented by~\citet{Jurek:15}, who
computed the negative and positive polarity of a message ($F_p$ and
$F_n$) using the following equations: { \small%
  \begin{align}
    F_P &= \min\left(\frac{A_P}{2 - \log(3.5\times W_P + I_P)}, 100\right),\\
    F_N &= \max\left(\frac{A_N}{2 - \log(3.5\times W_N + I_N)}, -100\right);\label{cgsa:eq:jurek}
  \end{align}%
  \normalsize%
}%
where $A_P$ and $A_N$ represent the average scores of positive and
negative lexicon terms found in the tweet, $W_P$ and $W_N$ stand for
the raw counts of such items, and $I_P$ and $I_N$ denote the number of
intensifiers preceding the lexicon terms.  Furthermore, in case of a
negation, the authors additionally modified the individual polarity
scores $s_w$ of the negated words $w$'s while estimating the average
polarity values as follows: { \small%
  \begin{align}
neg(s_w) =
    \begin{cases}
        \min\left(\frac{s_w - 100}{2}, -10\right) & \text{if } s_w > 0,\\
        \max\left(\frac{s_w + 100}{2}, 10\right), & \text{if } s_w < 0.
    \end{cases}
\end{align}%
\normalsize%
}%
Besides estimating the polarity scores $F_p$ and $F_n$,
\citeauthor{Jurek:15} also determined the subjectivity degree of the
message by replacing the terms $A_P$ and $A_N$ in
Equation~\ref{cgsa:eq:jurek} with averaged conditional probabilitites
of the tweet being subjective given that the respective polar term
appeared in it.\footnote{These probabilities were calculated
  automatically on the noisily labeled data set of~\citet{Go:09}.}
The authors considered a microblog as positive or negative if its
overall polarity score was greater than 25, and the subjectivity value
was higher than 0.5.  With this method, they achieved an accuracy
of~77.3\% on the manually annotated subset of \citeauthor{Go:09}'s
corpus and reached 74.2\% on the IMDB corpus~\cite{Maas:11}.

% Kolchyna et al., 2015
Finally, \citet{Kolchyna:15} also explored two different ways of
computing the overall polarity of a microblog:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item by simply averaging the scores of the lexicon terms found in the
  message and
\item by taking the signed logarithm of this average:
\end{inparaenum}
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Score}_{\log} =
  \begin{cases}
    \text{sign}(\text{Score}_{\text{AVG}})\log_{10}(|\text{Score}_{\text{AVG}}|) & %
    \text{if |Score}_{\text{AVG}}| > 0.1,\\
    0, & \text{otherwise};
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}%
comparing theses approaches on the SemEval-2013
dataset~\cite{Nakov:13}.  The authors determined the final polarity
class of a tweet with the help of $k$-means clustering, which utilized
either of the above polarity scores as its features.  They showed that
the logarithmic strategy performed better than the simple average
solution, yielding an accuracy of 61.74\%.  In addition to that,
\citeauthor{Kolchyna:15} also checked whether these lexicon values
could serve as useful attributes for an ML-based method.  For this
purpose, they retrained a cost-sensitive SVM
classifier~\cite{Masnadi:12} after extending its $n$-gram feature set
with lexicon features, getting almost five percent accuracy
improvement (from 86.62 to 91.17) on the IMDB movie review
dataset~\cite{Pang:02}.

\section{Machine-Learning Based Methods}\label{sec:cgsa:ml-based}

Despite their immense popularity, linguistic plausibility, and
simplicity to implement, lexicon-based approaches often have been
criticized for the rigidness of their classification\footnote{Since
  these systems only rely on the pre-computed weights of the lexicon
  entries, considering these coefficients as constant, their decision
  boundaries frequently appear to be suboptimal as many terms might
  have different polarity and intensity values depending on the domain
  of the text \cite[see][]{Yang:17}.} and the inability to factor in
additional, non-lexical attributes into the final decisions.
Moreover, as noted by~\citet{Pang:02} and confirmed
by~\citet{Riloff:03} and \citet{Gamon:04}, many of the linguistic
expressions which actually correlate with the subjectivity and
polarity of a sentence are very unlikely to be included into a
sentiment lexicon by a human expert.  As a consequence of this, with
the emergence of new manually annotated corpora, lexicon-based systems
have gradually been superseded by supervised machine-learning
techniques.

One of the first steps in this direction was taken
by~\citet{Wiebe:99}, who used a Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier to
differentiate between subjective and objective statements.  Using
primarily binary features which reflected the presence of a pronoun,
an adjective, a cardinal number, or a modal verb in the analyzed
sentence, achieved an accuracy of~72.17\%, outperforming the majority
class baseline by more than 20~percentage points.  An even better
result (81.5\%) could be reached when the dataset was restricted only
to the examples with the most confident annotations.

\done[inline]{\citet{Pang:02}}

Further notable contributions to DL-based CGSA methods were made
by~\citet{Pang:02}, who compared Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and
SVM systems on the polarity classification task for movie reviews,
getting their best results (82.9\% accuracy) with the SVM approach
that used only unigram features.

\done[inline]{\citet{Riloff:03a}}

\citet{Riloff:03a} addressed the problem of inusfficient manually
annotated sentiment resources by proposing a bootstrapping method for
training a subjectivity classifier.  In this approach, the authors
first applied two high-precision predictors to a large collection of
unlabeled sentences in order to get an initial set of subjective and
objective instances.  Afterwards, they used the AutoSlog-TS
algorithm~\cite{Riloff:96} to extract expressions which strongly
correlated with the subjective class and employed these phrases to
classify the remaining sentences from the corpus.
\citeauthor{Riloff:03a} repeated the last two steps (pattern
extraction and expansion of the training set) multiple times to
transitively learn new subjective phrases.  With the final system, the
authors achieved a precision of 0.902 on recognizing polar sentences,
with their recall running up to 0.401.

\done[inline]{\citet{Yu:03}}

A semi-supervised classification approach was proposed
by~\citet{Yu:03}, who presented a three-stage method, in which they
first distinguished between subjective and objective documents, then
differentiated between polar and neutral sentences, and, finally,
classified the polarity of opinionated clauses.  The authors used a
Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifer for the document-level task, reaching a
remarkable \F-score of~0.96 on this objective; and applied an ensemble
of NB systems to predict the subjectivity of the sentences.  In the
final step, they determined the semantic orientation of a subjective
clause by averaging the polarity scores of their tokens, getting these
scores from an automatically constructed sentiment
lexicon~\cite{Hatzivassi:97}.  With this approach, \citeauthor{Yu:03}
attained an accuracy of~91\% on a set of 38 sentences which had a
perfect inter-annotator agreement in their data.

\done[inline]{\citet{Gamon:04}}

Another SVM approach was proposed by~\citet{Gamon:04}, who used this
classifier in conjunction with a rich set of linguistic
(part-of-speech trigrams, constituent-specific length measures,
context free phrase structure patterns, as well as part-of-speech
information coupled with semantic relations) and surface features
(primarily word $n$-grams) to classify customer feedback into positive
and negative messages.  The author achieved his best results (77.5\%
accuracy and $\approx$0.77~\F) using top 2,000 features with the
highest log likelihood ratios.  Interestingly enough,
\citeauthor{Gamon:04} also could obtain quite competitive figures
(74.5\% accuracy) by using linguistically motivated features only.

\done[inline]{\citet{Wilson:04,Wilson:06}}

A related problem, namely that of classifying the strength of
opinions, was addressed by~\citet{Wilson:04,Wilson:06}.  In
particular, the authors proposed a wide variety of linguistic features
(including automatically learned lexico-syntactic patterns similar to
the ones used by~\citet{Riloff:03}, bags of words, and syntactic
attributes such as lemma and PoS tag of the root of a dependency tree,
lemmas and tags of its intermediate nodes and leaves, lexicalized
relation tuples, i.e., tuples consisting of the lemma of a parent
node, its grammatical relation to the child, and the lemma of the
child itself, etc.), checking the utility of these attributes with
three different classifiers: BoosTexter~\cite{Schapire:00},
Ripper~\cite{Cohen:95}, and SVMLight~\cite{Joachims:99}.
\citet{Wilson:04} achieved their best results (55\%~accuracy and
0.991~mean squared error) with the BoosTexter approach when using all
the introduced features.

\done[inline]{\citet{Pang:04}}

\citet{Pang:04} proposed a two-stage procedure for classifying the
overall semantic orientation of movie reviews (positive vs. negative):
In the first step of this approach, they classified the sentences into
subjective and objective ones (achieving 92\% accuracy for this task
with the Na\"ive Bayes system) and then applied another Na\"ive Bayes
classifier to determine the polarity of the review based on only
subjective excerpts, getting a statistically significant improvement
from~82.8 to~86.4\%.  The authors also experimented with the min-cut
method to encode the idea that nearby sentence will likely share the
same subjectivity class, but did not get any statistically significant
improvement over the discourse-unaware baseline.

\done[inline]{\citet{Cui:06}}

\citet{Cui:06} questioned the claim of~\citet{Pang:02} that
higher-order $n$-grams worsen the classification results of an opinion
mining system, hypothesizing that this finding was mostly due to the
limited training set size of the latter authors.  To check this
hypothesis, \citeauthor{Cui:06} collected a set of 320K product
reviews from \url{froogle.google.com} and trained three different NL
classifiers on these data: an online passive-agreessive
system~\cite{Crammer:06}, the winnow algorithm~\cite{Hurst:04}, and a
generative language model~\cite{Manning:99}.  The authors achieved
their best results with the first option, getting 0.9007 overall
\F-scores for both polarity classes and observing consistent
improvements with the increasing order of $n$-grams.  Moreover,
\citeauthor{Cui:06} also refuted another argument
of~\citet{Pang:04}---namely, the need for skipping objective sentences
while doing polarity classification---conjecturing that this step was
only useful for certain domains such as movie or book reviews, but
could not generalize to more technical genres.

\done[inline]{\citet{Ng:06}}

The results of~\citet{Pang:04} were further improved by~\citet{Ng:06}
who simultaneously addressed two classification problems:
distinguishing whether a given passage was a review or not and
determining the polarity of a review text.  The authors attained
impressive results (99.8\% accuracy) for the former task, using only
an SVM classifier with unigram features.  Moreover, they also
outperformed the then state of the art on the \citet{Pang:04}'s
corpus, boosting the accuracy from~87.1 to~90.5\%.  These changes were
mostly due to a smarter use of higher-order $n$-grams, where, instead
of bluntly considering all token sequences up to the order $n$ as new
features, \citet{Ng:06} only took 5,000 most useful ones, measuring
their utility with the weightes log-likelihood ratio \cite{Nigam:00}.

\done[inline]{\citet{Pang:05}}

\citet{Pang:05} addressed the problem of multi-class rating
prediction, whose goal, in contrast to the normal positive
vs. negative classification, was to determine the number of stars that
an author might assign to his review.  In their experiments,
\citeauthor{Pang:05} tried out three different strategies:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item one-versus-all SVM (OVA-SVM),
  \item SVM regression,
  \item and OVA-SVM with \emph{metric labeling}.
\end{inparaenum}
In the last approach, in addition to maximizing the score of the
correct labels, the authors also explicitly encoded the objective of
minimizing the absolute difference between the predicted labels of
similar training examples (measuring this similarity with the
percentage of positive sentences).  This strategy brought
statistically significant improvements over the first two baselines,
yielding an average accuracy of $\approx$52\%.

\done[inline]{\citet{Bickerstaffe:10}}

\citet{Bickerstaffe:10} also considered the rating prediction task,
addressing this problem with the minimum-spanning-tree (MST) SVM
approach.  In the initial step of this method, they constructed a
strongly connected graph whose vertices were associated with the most
representative example (determined via the average all-pairs Tanimoto
coefficient) of each star rating and the edge weights represented the
Tanimoto distances between those nodes.  Afterwards, they determined
the MST of this graph using the Kruskal's
algorithm~\cite[see][pp.~567--574]{Cormen:09} and, finally,
constructed a decision tree from this MST, replacing the MST vertices
with binary SVM classifiers, which had to discern the respective
rating groups. An evaluation on the four-star review corpus
of~\citet{Pang:05} showed an improvement by up to~7\% over the
previous state of the art, boosting it to 59.37\% average accuracy.

\citet{Li:10b} addressed the problem of polarity shifting using
machine-learning techniques.  For this purpose, the authors first
selected most frequent and indicative features of the two main
polarity classes (positive and negative), and then culled training
instances containing these attributes whose labels, however, were
different from the ones sugested by the features.  After obtaining
this polarity shifted subset, \citeauthor{Li:10b} trained several
linear support-vector classifiers, one of which had to distinguish
between polarity-shifted and polarity-preserving sentences, the other
two were to classify the semantic orientation of these two groups
(i.e., one system had to predict the polarity of shifted instances,
and the other one had to determine the semantic orientation of
polarity-preserving ones), and the last one was trained on the
complete original dataset---the product review corpus
of~\citet{Blitzer:06}---again to predict the polarity of complete
sentences disregarding their possible polarity shifts.  The authors
achieved their best results~(80,9\% average accuracy) using a
combination of the last three systems with a special meta-classifier
joining their single decisions.

\citet{Mejova:11} investigated the effect of different features on
various datasets---the movie review corpus of~\citet{Pang:04}, the
product reviews gathered by~\citet{Jindal:07}, and the customer
feedback dataset of~\citet{Blitzer:06}, coming to the conclusion that,
in general, preserving the original form of tokens (i.e., keeping the
original token forms instead of lemmas) and using their frequency
scores instead of binary values was beneficial to the results on all
test sets.  The use of different $n$-gram lengths, however, had a
mixed effect with the best scores typically yielded by the union of
uni-, bi-, and tri-gram features.  Last but not least, they found the
negation heuristics proposed by~\citet{Das:01} (adding the \emph{_NOT}
suffix to all tokens following a negation up to the first punctuation)
leading to only marginal improvements.  The authors achieved their
best results (87.5\%, 94.7\%, and 89.6\% accuracy on the datasets of
\citet{Pang:04}, \citet{Jindal:07}, and \citet{Blitzer:06},
respectively) with the union of unnormalized uni-, bi-gram and
tri-gram features without negation when using term frequencies as
feature values.

Riloff, Patwardhan and Wiebe (2006) studied relationships among
different features. They defined subsumption relationships among
unigrams, n-grams and lexico-syntactic patterns. If a feature is
subsumed by another, the subsumed feature is not needed. This can
remove many redundant features.

In (Liu et al., 2010), different linguistic features were compared for
both blog and review sentiment classification.


ReviewSA: this is the approach proposed by Pang and Lee (Pang and Lee,
2004) for sentiment analysis in regular online re- views. It performs
the subjectivity detec- tion on a sentence-level relying on the prox-
imity between sentences to detect subjectiv- ity. The set of sentences
predicted as subjec- tive is then classified as negative or positive
in terms of polarity using the unigrams that compose the sentences. We
used the imple- mentation provided by LingPipe (LingPipe, 2008);

In (Wang et al., 2011), the authors
proposed a graph-based hashtag approach to classifying Twitter post
sentiments

\todo[inline]{}

To the best of our knowledge, the idea of utilizing web texts
containing emoticons as noisily labeled training data was first
proposed by~\citet{Read:05}, who collected a set of 26,000 Usenet
posts featuring smileys or frownies and used these documents to train
a Na{\"i}ve Bayes and SVM classifier.  The author demonstrated that,
despite some encouraging results obtained on the instances from the
same domain (up to 70\% accuracy), the trained systems did not
generalize well to other text genres, barely outperforming the chance
baseline and reaching a maximum accuracy of~54.4\% on news data and
56.8\% on movie reviews.

The presumably first known attempt to adopt distant supervision for
the sentiment analysis of Twitter data was made by~\citet{Go:09} who
collected a set of 800,000 positive and 800,000 negative microblogs
relying on emoticons as their noisy labels.  After stripping off these
smileys from text, the authors trained three independent
ML-classifiers (Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector
Machines) on this collection, achieving their best results (82.7\%
accuracy) with the NB and MaxEnt systems thaat utilized unigrams and
bigrams as features.

Another distantly supervised approach was presented
by~\citet{Barbosa:10}, who gathered a collection of automatically
labeled tweets from three popular sentiment web sites (Twendz, Twitter
Sentiment, and TweetFeel), and trained two binary SVM systems on this
corpus.  The first of these classifiers had to distinguish between
subjective and objective microblogs, attaining an error rate of~18.1\%
on a subset of 1,000 manually annotated messages.  In the next step,
the second system had to determine the semantic orientation of
opinionated posts (positive or negative), reaching an error rate
of~18.7\% on this prediction.

In a similar way, \citet{Pak:10} gathered a collection of 300,000
noisily labeled tweets, ensuring an even distribution of positive,
negative, and neutral messages.  After a brief exploration of PoS tag
statistics in these different classes, they presented a Na{\"i}ve
Bayes system which utilized highly relevant binary part-of-speech and
$n$-gram features.\footnote{\citet{Pak:10} determined the relevance of
  a feature $f$ using a special \emph{salience} metric, which was
  defined as a negative ratio between the minimum and maximum
  conditional probabilities of this feature belonging to different
  target classes:
  \begin{equation*}
    salience(f) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^N 1 - \frac{\min(P(f, s_i), P(f, s_j))}{\max(P(f, s_i), P(f, s_j))},
  \end{equation*}
  where the $N$~term denotes the number of training examples, and
  $s_i$ means the sentiment class of the $i$-th training instance.}
With this approach, the authors attained an accuracy slighlty above
0.6 on the manually labeled test set of~\citet{Go:09}, also
demonstrating a particular utility of bigrams, negation rules, and
feature pruning heuristics.

A slightly different task was addressed by~\citet{Davidov:10}, who
sought to predict hashtags and emoticons occurring in tweets using a
$k$-NN classifier trained on a large collection of messages.  The
authors achieved an \F-measure of~0.31 on the former task, and reached
an \F-score of~0.64 on predicting smileys.

\citet{Kouloumpis:11} trained an AdaBoost
classifier~\cite{Schapire:00} on two large collections of noisily
labeled tweets---the emoticon tweebank of~\citet{Go:09} and the
Edinburgh hashtag corpus.\footnote{\url{http://demeter.inf.ed.ac.uk}}
Using $n$-gram (up to length two), lexicon, part-of-speech, and
micro-blogging features (such as emoticons, abbreviations, and slang
expressions), the authors achieved a macro-averaged \F-measure of~0.68
on the three-class prediction task.

% One of the first attempts to analyze message-level sentiments on
% Twitter was made by \citet{Go:09}.  For their experiments, the authors
% collected a set of 1,600,000 tweets containing smileys.  Based on
% these emoticons, they automatically derived polarity classes for these
% messages (positive or negative) and used them to train a Na\"{\i}ve
% Bayes, MaxEnt, and SVM classifier.  The best $F$-score for this
% two-class classification problem could be achieved by the last system
% and run up to 82.2\%.

% Similar work was also done by \citet{Pak:10} who used the Na\"{\i}ve
% Bayes approach to differentiate between neutral, positive, and
% negative microblogs; and \citet{Barbosa:10} who gathered a collection
% of 200,000 tweets, subsequently analyzing them with three publicly
% available sentiment web-services and training an SVM classifier on the
% results of these predictors.  In a similar way, \citet{Agarwal:11}
% compared a simple unigram-based SVM approach with two other
% full-fledged systems, one which relied on a rich set of manually
% defined features, and another used partial tree
% kernels~\cite{Moschitti:06}.  The authors evaluated these methods on a
% commercially acquired corpus of 8,753 foreign-language tweets, which
% were automatically translated into English, finding that a combination
% of these methods worked best for both two- and three-way prediction
% tasks.

% The state-of-the-art results for message level polarity prediction on
% tweets were established by~\citet{Mohammad:13}, whose system (a
% supervised SVM classifier) used a rich set of various features
% including word and character n-grams, PoS statistics, Brown
% clusters~\cite{Brown:92}, etc., and also strongly benefitted from

% Hashtag~\cite{Mohammad:12,Kiritchenko:14}.  This approach ranked first
% at the SemEval competition~2013~\cite{Nakov:13} and anchieved the
% fourth place on the rerun of this task one year
% later~\cite{Rosenthal:14}, being outperformed by the supervised
% logistic regression approach of~\citet{Miura:14}, who used a heavy

% improved by the apporaches of~\citet{Hagen:15} and \citet{Deriu:16},

Since there was not a complete set of such expressions, it provided
some seeds and then used distributional similarity (Lin, 1998) to find
similar words, which were also likely to be subjectivity
indicators. However, words found this way had low precision and high
recall.

\citet{Yessenalina:11}

A real breakthrough in the use of deep neural networks for the
sentence-level sentiment analysis happened with the pioneering work
of~\citet{Socher:11}, who first introduced a recursive autoencoder
(RAE).  In this system, the authors obtained a fixed-width vector
representation for complex phrases $\vec{v}$ by recursively merging
the vectors of adjacent tokens (say $\vec{w}_1$ and $\vec{w}_2$),
first multiplying these vectors with a compositional matrix $W$ and
then applying a non-linear function ($softmax$) to the resulting
product:
\begin{align*}
  \vec{c} &= softmax\left(W\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
  \vec{w}_1\\
  \vec{w}_2
  \end{bmatrix}\right)
\end{align*}
Using a max-margin classifier on top of the resulting phrase
representation, \citet{Socher:11} could improve the state-of-the-art
results on predicting the sentence-level polarity of user's blog
posts~\cite{Potts:10} and also outperformed the system
of~\citet{Nasukawa:03} on the MPQA data set~\cite{Wiebe:05}.

Later on, \citet{Socher:12} further improved these scores with the
help of a recursive matrix-vectors space model (RMVSM), in which each
word was associated with a 2-tuple of a vector and matrix---e.g.,
$(\vec{w}_1, W_1)$ and $(\vec{w}_2, W_2)$---and the compositionality
function was redefined as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \vec{c} &= softmax\left(W\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
  W_2\cdot\vec{w}_1\\
  W_1\cdot\vec{w}_2
  \end{bmatrix}\right)
\end{align*}

An important breakthrough in the usage of deep learning methods for
sentiment analysis on Twitter happened with the
work~\citet{Severyn:15}, whose proposed feed-forward DL system ranked
first in Subtask~10-A (phrase-level polarity prediction) at
SemEval~2015 \cite{Rosenthal:15} and got second place in Subtask~10-B
(message-level classification) of this competition.  Drawing on the
ideas of~\citet{Kalchbrenner:14}, the authors devised a simple
convolutional neural network in which they first passed pre-trained
word2vec embeddings to a set of 300 convolutional kernels (each of
width five), and then fed the max-pooled results of this
multiplication to a densely connected softmax layer.  Two important
aspects of this approach, which accounted for a huge part of its
success, were
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item that the word2vec vectors were used solely for initialization,
  but were then modified along with other model's paramaters during
  training, and
\item that \citeauthor{Severyn:15} extended to the original SemEval
  training set with an additional, much larger noisily labeled corpus.
\end{inparaenum}
These improvements allowed the authors to establish a new state of the
art on the phrase-level polarity prediction task with a macro-averaged
\F-score of 0.8479, also getting a competitive result of 0.6459~\F{}
on classifying the semantic orientation of messages.

\section{Coarse-Grained Sentiment Analysis Using Language and Domain
  Adaptation}\label{sec:cgsa:domain-adaptation}

One of the first works which pointed out the importance of domain
adaptation for sentiment analysis was introduced by~\citet{Aue:05}.
In their experiments, the authors trained separate SVM classifiers on
four different document sets: movie reviews, book reviews, customer
feedback from a product support service, and a feedback survey from a
customer knowledge base; finding that each classifier performed best
when applied to the same domain as it was trained on.  In order to
find an optimal way of overcoming this domain specificity,
\citet{Aue:05} tried out four different options:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item\label{sent-cgsa:lst:rel-wrk1} training one classifier on all but
  the target domain and applying it to the latter;
\item using the same procedure as above, but limiting the features to
  only those which also appeared in the target texts;
\item taking an ensemble of individual classifiers each of which was
  trained on a different data collection; and, finally,
\item using a minimal subset of labeled in-domain data to train a
  Na{\"i}ve Bayes system with the expectation-maximization algorithm
  \cite[EM;][]{Dempster:77}.
\end{inparaenum}
The authors found that the ensemble and EM options worked best for
their cross-domain task, achieving an accuracy of up to 82.39\% for
the two-class prediction (positive vs negative) on new unseen text
genres.

Another notable milestone in the domain adaptation research was set
by~\citet{Blitzer:07}.  Relying on their previous work on structural
correspondence learning~\cite{Blitzer:07}, in which they used a set of
\emph{pivot features} (features which frequently appeared in both
target and source domains) to find an optimal correspondence of the
remaining attributes,\footnote{In particular, the authors trained $m$
  binary predictors for each of their $m$ pivot features in order to
  find other attributes which frequently co-occurred with the pivots.
  Afterwards, they composed these $m$ resulting weight vectors into a
  single matrix $W := [\vec{w}_{1},\ldots,\vec{w}_{m}]$, took an SVD
  decomposition of this matrix, and used the top $h$ left singular
  vectors to translate source features to the new domain.} the authors
refined their method by pre-selecting the pivots using their PMI
scores and improving misaligned feature projections using a small set
of labeled target examples.  With these modifications,
\citeauthor{Blitzer:07} were able to reduce the average adaptation
loss (the accuracy drop when transferring a classifier to a different
domain) from 9.1 to 4.9~percent when testing a sentiment predictor on
the domains of book, dvd, electical appliances, and kitchen reviews.

Other important works on domain adaptation for opinion mining include
those of~\citet{Read:05}, who pointed out that sentiment
classification might not only depend on the domain but also on topic,
time, and language style in which the text was written;
\citet{Tan:07}, who proposed using the classifier trained on the
source domain to classify unlabeled instances from the target genre,
and then iteratively retrain the system on the enriched data set.
Finally, \citet{Andreevskaia:08} proposed a combination of a lexicon-
and ML-based systems, claiming that this ensemble would be more
resistible to the domain shift than each of these classifiers on their
own.

Another line of research was introduced by~\citet{Glorot:11} who
proposed stacked denoising autoencoders (SDA)---a neural network
architecture in which an input vector $\vec{x}$ was first mapped to a
smaller representation $\vec{x}'$ via some function
$h: \vec{x}\mapsto\vec{x}'$, and then restored to its approximate
original state via an inverse transformation
$g: \vec{x}'\mapsto\vec{x}''\approx\vec{x}$.  In their experiments,
the authors optimized the parameters of the functions $h$ and $g$ on
both target and source data, getting approximate representations of
instances from both data sets; and then trained a linear SVM
classifier on the restored representations of the source instances,
subsequently applying this classifier to the target domain.  This
approach was further refined by~\citet{Chen:12} who analytically
computed the reconstruction function~$g$, and used both original and
restored features to predict the polarity labels of the target
data.\footnote{Both approaches were trained tested on the Amazon
  Review Corpus of~\citet{Blitzer:07}.}


Further notable contributions to domain adaptation in general were
made by~\citet{Daume:07} who proposed to replicate each extracted
feature three times and train the first replication on both domains,
the second repetion only on source, and the third copy only on target
domain, for which he assumed a small subset of labeled examples was
available; \citet{Yang:15} who trained neural embeddings of features,
trying to predict which instance attributes frequently co-occured with
each other;
