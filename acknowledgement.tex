\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgments}

At the beginning of this thesis, I would like to say a big thank you
to all people who faithfully supported me throughout these years of
working on my dissertation: my colleagues, my friends, my teachers, my
advisor and, first of all, my family.  I am heavily indebted to all
these supporters and am absolutely convinced that this work would have
never come into existence without them.  I am also sure that it would
take me another thesis to express the whole debt of gratitude that I
owe each of my helpers, but am afraid that none of them would like to
wait that long for me to finish it.  Therefore, as hard as it is, I
have to be brief in these acknowledgments and will describe all the
infinite gratefulness that I feel with just few, but utterly sincere
words.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my family, who were
incessantly standing by my side throughout this difficult and
exhausting endeavor.  Unfortunately, they also were those who suffered
most from my absence at home and the lack of my spare time.  So,
taking the opportunity to speak to them from these pages, I would like
to apologize for my heavily neglected family duties and promise that I
will make up for them twofold after the defense.

Second, I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Manfred
Stede, for his courage in accepting me as a Ph.D. student; for the
infinite patience during the course of this work; for the numerous
wise suggestions; and, of course, for the time he invested in
discussing and reviewing parts of this work.

Using the chance, I would also like to thank Jacob Eisenstein for his
consent to be the reviewer of my dissertation and that he unknowingly,
through his papers, has become my second, imaginary advisor (as a
complex person I allow myself to have imaginary friends).

For sure, writing this thesis would not have been half as fun if there
had not been such wonderful colleagues and people as Arne Neumann,
Andr\'e Herzog, Tatjana Scheffler, Thomas Hanneforth, Yulia Grishina,
Andreas Peldszus, Sarah Hemmen, and Daniel Schultheis, who not only
supported me at critical moments but also shared with me the
occasional instants of joy.  There are definitely many other people
who should have been mentioned here, but as I said, I would like to be
brief, and if I failed to name someone explicitly in these
acknowledgments, please be assured that I did it not for lack of
gratitude but due to the limited writing space and time.

%% And at least to mitigate this omission, I would like to address my
%% final big thank you to all those who remained unnamed in these
%% acknowledgments, but feel that they were this work.

%% Speaking of colleagues and friends, I, of course, would like to thank
%% Nikos Engonopoulos and Mart\'{i}n Villalba for many enjoyable hours
%% that I have spent in their company and also express my sincere
%% gratitude to our technical assistants -- Annett E\ss{}linger , Ralf
%% Ditsch, and Siegfried Wrobel -- for their invaluable help in solving
%% everyday issues.

%% Annett has always been indispensable in handling all my questions
%% concering official documents.  And thanks to Ralf and Siegfried, we
%% had an excellent network infrastructure which helped me organize my
%% work more efficiently.
