\textbf{Acknowledgment.}

At the beginning of this thesis, I would like to say a really big thank you to
all people who supported me throughout these difficult yet immensely enjoyable
years of work on my dissertation; to people who always were there, when I
needed them; to people who taught, advised, and helped me with my research and
who, I believe, made me stronger, perhaps more clever, and probably also more
confident in my knowledge.  These people are my colleagues, my friends, my
teachers, but, first of all, my family and my advisor.  I am heavily indebted
to all of them and I am absolutely convinced that this work had never come
into existence if I did not have such a great working environment as I was
lucky to have it in Potsdam.

It would surely take me another dissertation to express the whole debt of
gratitude that I owe each of my supporters, but I am afraid they would not
like to wait for me that long to finish it.  Therefore, as hard as it is, I
have to constrain myself in this acknowledgment and describe all the infinite
gratefulness that I feel for my helpers with just few but most important
words.  And even if I fail to mention somebody on these pages or if you think
that I mentioned somebody too briefly, please know that it is not due to the
lack of my gratefulness but to the lack of writing space and time.

So, to cut the long story short, I, first of all, certainly would like to
thank my advisor, Manfred Stede, who was much more a ``Doktorvater'' than just
a supervisor for me.  I thank Manfred for his courage in employing me, for the
numerous hours that he invested in our discussions, and for his valuable
hints, suggestions, and criticism.  His experience and wisdom laid the
foundation for the success of this work.  And his patience allowed me to bring
this thesis to the end.  I am very thankful to Manfred that he introduced me
to the amazing world of science, a world which does not require a visa but
which does require a sober mind and a considerable load of knowledge.  And I
sincerely hope that he will open the doors to this unbelievably beautiful
world for many other Ph.D. students that he will certainly have in future.

Of course, having a good ``Doktorvater'' is an invaluable precondition for any
completed dissertation, but another prerequisite which plays an equally
important role is still one's own family at home.  And I have to admit that I
was extremely lucky with both my families: the scientific and the traditional
one.  My wife and my parents have always given me incredible support.  But,
unfortunately, they also were those people who, I think, suffered most from my
absence and lack of my spare time.  So, taking this rare opportunity to speak
to them from these pages, I would like to simultaneously apologize for my
possibly neglected family duties and to promise that I will make up for it in
future.

My time at the University of Potsdam had certainly never been that enjoyable
if I did not have such great colleagues as Tatjana Scheffler, Arne Neumann,
Yulia Grishina, Andreas Peldszus, and Jonathan Sonntag.  I thank Tatjana for
her help with our research project ``Discourse Analysis of Social Media'' and
for her valuable advices and corrections of my papers.  I thank Arne for our
talks, cultural excursions, and his nice attitude to people.  And I am, of
course, much indebted to Yulia who was the most reliable annotator in our
numerous conducted annotation experiments.

I am also very grateful to our colleagues from the chair of Theoretical
Computational Linguistics -- Alexander Koller and Thomas Hanneforth.  The
unsurpassable level of Alexander's professional competence and the consummate
quality of his work set an example for me that I eagerly tried to follow.  And
even if my attempt is still far away from being completed, it would be even
less successful if I did not take the unique opportunity to visit Thomas
Henneforth's fanastic courses in automata theory and C++.  And I would like to
say a particular thank you to Thomas for the priceless research hints that he
gave me in our discussions.

With greatest gratitude, I should also mention Konstantina Garoufi, Nikos
Engonopoulos, Mart\'{i}n Villalba, and \v{Z}eljko Agi\'{c}.  It has always
been a pleasure for me to listen to them in our talks and to enjoy their
company during our common lunches.  I wish them great success in their
academic and industrial careers and I am also already looking forward to
seeing them on conferences, workshops, and meetings.
