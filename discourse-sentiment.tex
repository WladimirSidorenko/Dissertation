\subsection{Related Work}
One of the first discourse-aware approaches to coarse-grained
sentiment analysis was proposed by~\citet{Pang:04}.  In their work,
the authors partitioned the text of a movie review into subjective and
objective sentences using the min-cut method of~\citet{Blum:01}, and
then analyzed the sentences from the former group in order to classify
the overall polarity of the review.

\citet{Somasundaran:08,Somasundaran:08a} introduced the concept of
\emph{opinion frames} which represented a pair of subjective
statements (arguments or sentiments) that were related to each via the
\emph{same} or \emph{alternative} link.  In the former case, both
statements had to refer to the same target, while, in the latter case,
these targets had to represent mutually exclusive alternatives.

\citet{Voll:07} addressed the problem of classifying the polarity of
Epinions reviews.\footnote{\url{www.epinions.com}} For this purpose,
they applied the SO-CAL system (Semantic Orientation CALculator) to
adjectives appearing in the user posts, considering three ways of
pre-filtering this input: In the first (baseline) approach, they
invariably passed all adjectives found in the review to SO-CAL.  In
the second method, they only analyzed those words which appeared in
the top-most nuclei of the sentences.  These nuclei were determined
automatically by an RST parsing system \cite[SPADE; ][]{Soricut:03}.
Finally, in the third experiment, the authors trained a decision-tree
classifier, which predicted whether a particular sentence pertained to
the general topic of its document or not, and applied the sentiment
system only to those sentences which were classified as
topic-relevant.  With this last approach, \citeauthor{Voll:07} were
able to obtain their best results (69\% accuracy), getting their
second-best scores with the system which considered all adjectives.
The suboptimal results of the discourse-based approach were partially
explained by the limited performance of the automatic RST system.

Another joint framework for predicting the polarity of both sentences
and documents was described by \cite{McDonald:07}.  In their work, the
authors designed a unified CRF system, in which the predicted labels
of the sentences formed a linear chain and simultaneously were
connected to the label node of the whole document which had to be
predicted along with sentence orientations.

\citet{Yessenalina:10} proposed a latent-variable approach, in which
they tried to predict the overall polarity of a document (movie review
or congressional floor debate) by estimating the difference between
the polarities of the most prominent subjective sentences.  Since the
labels of the sentences were unknown at the training and testing time,
the authors considered their polaity scores as latent variables whose
most likely assignments were to be determined with a structural SVM
algorithm~\cite{Yu:09}.  An enhancement of this algorithm was
presented by~\citet{Trivedi:13}, who extended the original training
objective with a set of discourse connectives attributes and polarity
coherence features.

Other ways of incorporating discourse structure into opinion mining
applications were proposed by~\citet{Bhatia:15}.  In their work, the
authors proposed two methods for augmenting a sentiment analysis
system with discourse information:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item discourse depth reweighting and
\item rhetorical recursive neural network (R2N2).
\end{inparaenum}
In the former approach, they introduced a special parameter $\lambda_i$:
\begin{equation*}
  \lambda_i = \max\left(0.5, 1 - d_i/6\right),
\end{equation*}
where $d_i$ stands for the depth of an elementary discourse unit in
the discourse tree of the whole document.  With this parameter, they
estimated the overall polarity of a document~$\Psi$, by summing up the
individual linaer predictions for each sentence scaled by~$\lambda_i$:
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi = \sum_i\lambda_i\mathbf{\theta}^T\cdot\mathbf{w}_i,
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{\theta}$ represents a vector of polarity scores ($-1$
for negative terms and $+1$ for positive) obtained from the sentiment
lexicon of~\citet{Wilson:05}, and $w_i$ stands for the bag-of-words
representation of the $i$-th sentence.  In the R2N2 method, the
authors adopted the RNN approach of~\citet{Socher:13} and recursively
estimated the polarity of a document from the leaves of the RST tree
up to its root.

Other notable works on discourse-level sentiment analysis include
those of~\citet{Mao:06}, who used isotonic CRFs to predict the
polarity of single sentences and then used a nearest neighbors
classifier to induce the polarity of the whole document from these
predictions, observing an improvement over the traditional
bag-of-words approach.

Other notable works on discourse-augented sentiment analysis include
those of~\citet{Snyder:07}, who proposed a joint Good Grief model to
predict users' evaluations of different restaurant aspects.  In the
first phase of framework, a set of aspect-specific calssifiers was
applied to the input text.  In the next step, the output of this
ensemble was corrected by an additional linear classifier, which was
supposed to account for the agreement of multiple aspects.
